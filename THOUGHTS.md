#Principles
- Minimise model representation: FormVersion, DBVersion, APIVersion?
- Have a validation set specifically for form-data
- Provide lenses and schemas for all models
- Use components for dependency management
- Use single namespace for generating relative urls
- Use functional tests sparingly


#Libraries
- lib-noir
- prismatic schema
- traversy
- monger
